# BLONKS-CC0
Contracts are deployed and all are verified except for the traits contract.
After all tokens have been minted, the traits contract will be revealed, and all contracts will be uploaded to this github.

For now, only the main/minting contract will be put here, but for true due diligence, one should look up the contract that the website javascript interacts with - because that's the true contract while anything on any github will merely be, at best, a copy, and at worst, a fake.

So, I put the contract here for simplicity but if you've read this far before mint, do the extra legwork and hit the contract on Etherscan. :)
